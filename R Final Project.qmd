## Ski Jumping Results

Our data set is the Results of (almost) all important ski jumping competitions from 2009 to now. The observations contain standard information about every jump - style points, distance, take-off speed, wind etc.

## Research Questions: 

1.  How strong is the correlation between distance and style marks?

2.  Can we create a model that predicts the performance/distance of an athlete in a given competition?
